# Web Security

The purpose of this assignment was to gain experience analyzing a web
application for security vulnerabilities, and patching them. Our assignment
was to find authentication, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery,
and SQL injection vulnerabilities, and fix them. The original, vulnerable
version, as well as the fixed version, can be found in this repository.
