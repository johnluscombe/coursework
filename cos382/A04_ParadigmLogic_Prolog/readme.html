General
=======

inorder
-------
* **Calling Conventions**: Query `inorder` with a tree, and specifying a
  variable (for example: `In`) as a second parameter (e.g. `tree3(A), inorder(A, In).`).
* **Input and Output Data Formats**: A tree is the input, and the inorder tree
  traversal as a list is the output.
* **What May Be Different From Other Students**: Other students may have split
  the `append` functionality into two, whereas I did it with one. Both methods
  result in the same answer.

search
------
* **Calling Conventions**: Query `search` with a tree and a key (e.g. `tree3(A), search(A, 5).`).
* **Input and Output Data Formats**: A tree and a key are the inputs, and a
  boolean value (`true` or `false`) is the output.

sumtree
-------
* **Calling Conventions**: Query `sumtree` with a tree, and specifying a
  variable (for example: `Sum`) as a second parameter (e.g. `tree3(A), sumtree(A, Sum).`).
* **Input and Output Data Formats**: A tree is the input, and the sum is the
  output.

subtree
-------
* **Calling Conventions**: Query `subtree` with two trees (e.g. `tree1(A), tree4(B), subtree(A, B).`)
* **Input and Output Data Formats**: Two trees are the inputs, and a boolean
  value (`true` or `false`) is the output.

substitution
------------
* **Calling Conventions**: Query `substitution` with an old value, a new value,
  a tree, and specifying a variable (for example: `TreeY`) as a fourth
  parameter (e.g. `tree3(A), substitution(1, 9, A, TreeY).`).
* **Input and Output Data Formats**: An old value, a new value, and a tree are
  the inputs, and a tree with the old values replaced with the new values is
  the output.

ordered
-------
* **Calling Conventions**: Query `ordered` with a tree (e.g. `tree4(A), ordered(A).`).
* **Input and Output Data Formats**: A tree is the input, and a boolean value
  (`true` or `false`) is the output.


EXTRA CREDIT: binsearch
-----------------------
* **Calling Conventions**: Query `binsearch` with a tree and a key (e.g.
  `tree3(A), binsearch(A, 5).`).
* **Input and Output Data Formats**: A tree and a key are the inputs, and a
  boolean value (`true` or `false`) is the output.

Assignment Reflection
=====================
Hours to complete assignment (not including extra credit): ~3

I think this was a very beneficial assignment, helping us to learn Prolog
better. I still cannot seem to wrap my head around how Prolog works, which took
some enjoyment out of the assignment for me, but that is no fault of the
assignment.
