General
=======

Recursive Descent Program (Java)
--------------------------------
* **Calling Conventions**: Run `RescursiveDescent.java` under the `src`
  directory.
* **Input and output data formats**: Put the infix input into `input.txt`. The
  postfix output will appear in the terminal.
* **Modularization/Abstractions**: I followed the modularization and abstraction
  example of the RDP I did in the previous assignment, which used C.
* **Data Structures**: I used a hashtable so that repeating symbols would not
  show up twice.
* **Algorithms**: I used a lookahead pointer and recursive parse methods that
  interacted with that pointer to determine what to do with each character.
* My implementation may differ from other students in that it uses a lot of
  helper methods to accomplish the problem.
* There are two match methods, one for a single character, and one for an entire
  string that calls the character version.
* The `getchar()` method is there to mimic the previous assignment's RDP in C.

ANTLR with Actions
------------------
* **Calling Conventions**: Run `ActionTest.java` under the `actions` directory.
* **Input and output data formats**: Put the infix input into `input.txt` in the
  `src` directory. The postfix output will appear in the terminal.
* **Data Structures**: I used a hashtable so that repeating symbols would not
  show up twice.
* The amount of code I wrote to print out the symbol table may be more than most
  students, but it works.

ANTLR with Listener
-------------------
* **Calling Conventions**: Run `ListenerTest.java` under the `listener`
  directory.
* **Input and output data formats**: Put the infix input into `input.txt` in the
  `src` directory. The postfix output will appear in the terminal.
* **Data Structures**: I used a hashtable so that repeating symbols would not
  show up twice.
* Like in the ANTLR with Actions section, the amount of code I have to print
  everything in the correct format is likely more than most students,
  but it works.

I really enjoyed this assignment, and I learned a lot.
