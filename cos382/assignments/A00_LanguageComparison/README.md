## Assignment Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to implement the solution to a programming
problem in several different programming paradigms. The problem description is
stated in the next section.

## The Prime Partitions Problem

Many but not all positive integers can be written as a sum of distinct primes.
The number 12, for example, can be written as either 5+7 or 2+3+7. The numbers
4 and 6, on the other hand, have no partition into unique primes, and the
number 9 has only one: 2+7.

## Example Output given n = 20

```
2 + 5 + 13
2 + 7 + 11
3 + 17
7 + 13
```
