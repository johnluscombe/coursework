                **A01 - Language Recognition**

Student Info
=============

Your name: John Luscombe


Implementations
================

C
--------------------------------

![**Figure 1**: My C implementation in action](img/C.png width="600px")

- Calling conventions and input/output data formats
	1. Compile `LanguageRecognition.c` using gcc.
	2. Run in terminal `./a.out`.
	3. Type in a Bible reference into the prompt.
	4. The script will tell you if it is a valid Bible reference.
	5. Repeat steps 2-4 to do more Bible verses.

- Negative aspects (limitations, known bugs)

  - Error messages can sometimes be ambiguous. For example, typing `John 3:` into the prompt tells you that the newline character is invalid, rather than telling the user that the colon cannot be the last character.
  - Characters after the translation are ignored (may or may not actually be a limitation or bug)

- Positive aspects (extensions, special features)

  - Recognizes Bible books with multiple words (e.g. Song of Solomon).


ANTLR
--------------------------------

![**Figure 3**: My ANTLR implementation recognizing an invalid Bible reference](img/ANTLR_Invalid.png width="600px")

- Calling conventions and input/output data formats
	1. Install the ANTLR plugin into IntelliJ.
	2. Open the `.g4` file in IntelliJ.
	3. Look at the line `s : b r t ;`. Right-click the `s`, and select `Test Rule s`.
	4. Begin typing a valid Bible reference.
	5. As you type, ANTLR Preview will show you if a Bible reference is valid or invalid, and how the parse tree breaks down.

- Negative aspects (limitations, known bugs)

  - Characters after the translation are ignored (may or may not actually be a limitation or bug)

- Positive aspects (extensions, special features)

  - Recognizes Bible books with multiple words (e.g. Song of Solomon).


Perl Regex
--------------------------------

![**Figure 4**: My Perl Regex implementation in action](img/Regex.png width="600px")

- Calling conventions and input/output data formats
	1. Run in terminal `perl LanguageRecognition.pl`.
	2. Type in a Bible reference into the prompt.
	3. The script will tell you if it is a valid Bible reference.
	4. Repeat steps 1-3 to do more Bible verses.

- Negative aspects (limitations, known bugs)

  - When a Bible reference is invalid, the program does not tell you why.

- Positive aspects (extensions, special features)

  - Recognizes Bible books with multiple words (e.g. Song of Solomon).


Assignment Reflection
======================

Hours to complete assignment: ~6 hours

Other comments: I think this assignment was very interesting and fun! The only suggestion I would make is playing around with ANTLR before releasing the assignment, so you can explain exactly how to set it up. Otherwise, I think you should definitely keep this assignment!
