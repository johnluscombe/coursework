                **P00 - Domain and Problem**

**Group Info: John Luscombe, Sean Mitchem, Tim Parr**

Domain Definition
=================
The domain we selected is that of quiz generation. This could be used in
multiple contexts -- education in particular.

Problem Definition
==================
A user, such as a teacher, has a list of questions/answers to use on a test.
He or she wants a user-friendly way to create an HTML quiz, rather than
hard-coding it by hand every time.

We want to solve this problem by providing a user-friendly way of specifying
questions and answers in a specific type of file format. This file will then be
tranlsated into an HTML quiz.

Example "Solutions"
===================
Example input:

```txt
(OP)
| TITLE = Example Quiz
| SCRAMBLE_CHOICES = True
| SCRAMBLE_QUESTIONS = True
| QUESTION_COUNT = 2

What is the meaning of life?
| Tim Parr
> 42
| Dr. Denning
| Computer Science

Who is the best computer science professor?
| Dr. White
| Dr. Stanley
> Dr. Denning
| Alan Turing

What is the best major at Taylor?
| Professional Writing
> Alan Turing
| Underwater Basket Weaving
| Computer Science
```

Functionality
=============
At the beginning of the file, we specify options for the quiz generator, such
as whether or not to scramble choices, whether or not to scramble questions,
and how many questions to randomly select from the input file.

For the questions, the question is specified as-is, with no special delimiter.
For the choices for that question, we specify incorrect choices with a pipe '|',
and correct answers with a greater-than sign '>'.

Features -- Our program will read in data from an input file and will:

1. Create and display a quiz in html.
2. Shuffle the questions in the quiz if specified by the user.
3. Shuffle the choices in each question if specified by the user.
4. Select a specific number of random questions from the input file to use in the quiz.

Additionally, if we have time, we would like to add the option for the user to
be graded on their quiz responses. As a final stretch goal, we would like to
add the option of having fill-in-the-blank questions that are graded with
simple fuzzy matching.
