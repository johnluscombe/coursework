General
=======

`sum:`

* **Calling Conventions**: If `p1` and `p2` are polynomial objects, then inside
  of Playground or a Workspace, call `p1 sum: p2`. If you are using a Workspace,
  use the `inspect` method on an array representing the resulting object to see
  the results.
* **Input and output data formats**: Two polynomial objects are used as inputs
  (one as an object, and one as an argument), and a polynomial object (the sum
  of the two original polynomials) is the output.
* **Data structures**: In order to build the sum polynomial object, I started
  with an empty array, added the sum of the coefficients onto the array, and
  returned a new polynomial object initialized with that array.
* **Algorithms**: I used a to/do loop to go through each coefficient in the
  polynomials, I summed the coefficients at the respective positions, and I
  added the result to the sum polynomial array.

`evaluate:`

* **Calling Conventions**: If `p` is a polynomial object and `aNumber` is a
  number, then inside of Playground or a Workspace, call `p evaluate: aNumber`.
  If you are using a Workspace, use the `inspect` method on the resulting
  number to see the results.
* **Input and output data formats**: A polynomial object and a number (the
  argument) are used as inputs, and a number (the polynomial evaluation) is the
  output.
* **Algorithms**: I used a to/do loop to evaluate each coefficient in the
  polynomial, and add that to a running sum.

`evaluate`

* **Calling Conventions**: If `p` is a polynomial object, then inside of
  Playground or a Workspace, call `p evaluate`. If you are using a Workspace,
  use the `inspect` method on the resulting number to see the results.
* **Input and output data formats**: A polynomial object is used as an input
  in the code, and a number is used as an input inside a prompt window. A
  number (the polynomial evaluation) is the output.
* **Algorithms**: I used a to/do loop to evaluate each coefficient in the
  polynomial, and add that to a running sum.

`differentiate`

* **Calling Conventions**: If `p` is a polynomial object, then inside of
  Playground or a Workspace, call `p differentiate`. If you are using a
  Workspace, use the `inspect` method on an array representing the resulting
  object to see the results.
* **Input and output data formats**: A polynomial object is used as an input,
  and a polynomial object (the derivative) is the output.
* **Data structures**: In order to build the derivative polynomial object, I
  started with an empty array, added the derivative at each coefficient onto
  the array, and returned a new polynomial object initialized with that array.
* **Algorithms**: I used a to/do loop to go through each coefficient in the
  polynomial, I calculated the derivative at that coefficient, and I added the
  result to the derivative polynomial array.

`graphFrom:graphTo:`

* **Calling Conventions**: If `p` is a polynomial object, `a` is a starting
  number, and `b` is an ending number, call `p graphFrom: a graphTo: b`.
* **Input and output data formats**: A polynomial object and two numbers (the
  starting number and the ending number) are used as inputs, and a graph
  representing the polynomial is the output.
