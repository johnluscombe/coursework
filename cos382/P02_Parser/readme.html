                **P02 - Parser**

**Group Info: John Luscombe, Sean Mitchem, Tim Parr**

Domain Definition
=================
The domain we selected is that of quiz generation. This could be used in
multiple contexts -- education in particular.

Problem Definition
==================
A user, such as a teacher, has a list of questions/answers to use on a test.
He or she wants a user-friendly way to create an HTML quiz, rather than
hard-coding it by hand every time.

We want to solve this problem by providing a user-friendly way of specifying
questions and answers in a specific type of file format. This file will then be
tranlsated into an HTML quiz.

ANTLR Parser
==================

Calling Conventions, Input and Output Data Formats
--------------------------------------------------
We used ANTLR to implement a parser. We then tested it out using IntelliJ's
parse tree tools.

In order to run the tester, open the input.txt file.

The file should contain something like this:

```
(OP)
| TITLE = Example Quiz
| SCRAMBLE_CHOICES = True
END

What is the meaning of life?
| Tim Parr
> 42
| Dr. Denning
END
```

Copy all the text from the input.txt file. Now open the
QuizGeneratorRecognizer.g4 file in IntelliJ. Right-Click on the "file" rule and
select "Test Rule file". Paste your text from the input.txt into the input
section of the tester (refer to the screenshot). The tester should respond by
building a parse tree.

Challenges, Design Decision Justifications
------------------------------------------

A particular challenge we overcame was the fact that "options" is a keyword, and
we wanted to use it. The error message was not clear or helpful, but we
eventually figured it out and decided to use "more_options" instead. This is why
we used "more_options" as a rule name instead of just "options". [Here is a
screenshot of our parse tree.](parse_tree.png width="600px")
